## Overview
I took a semester off to build my own mobile app, which is a niche-specific social media built just for families. Without any prior knowledge in UX, I self-taught myself along the entire journey, which involved conducting a <a href="/pdf/Homy_A1.pdf" target="_blank"_>market research</a>, sketching wireframes, designing prototypes, and conducting usability tests.

## Impact
- I received 5K funding from Rehoboth Business Idea Competition
- State government support with free office space in the tech hub valley
- Developed storyboard and high fidelity prototype through iterations of market research, surveys, and user testing
- Hired a software engineer to develop into an app

## Problem Statement
We are spending the least time with the most important people in our lives, family, while spending more and more time with strangers, coworkers and friends. The cause of the problem has been generally identified as increased work and commute time, and busier individual routines.

## Design Question
> <p style="font-size: 16pt"><mark><em>"How might we recreate an online home where family members can seamlessly connect and provide emotional support?"</em></mark><br><br>

## Mission
Homy attempts to solve this growing social problem by recreating online home and allowing families to seamlessly connect. With unique post-it style fridge page, Homy wants to encourage families to communicate more often. The mission is *to provide emotional communication service to enrich familyâ€™s real, offline relationship.*
