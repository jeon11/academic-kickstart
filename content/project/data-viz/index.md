## Interactive Art: Image Reconstruction using Perlin Noise (p5.js Javascript)
</div><iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/jeon11/embed/w2Ugnl4dR" width="760" height="600">Image Reconstruction using Perlin Noise (Javascript- p5.js) </iframe>

The image above uses Perlin Noise to reconstruct old classic artworks, which is useful for generating patterns. Starting from a blank screen, it creates thousands of random noises that start recovering the image. They do so by reading the color of the image coordinates. The noises diffuse by generating random polygons spreading around, filling in the gap.

- Refresh the page to see different image creations (total 4 images).

- Drag the mouse to draw circles on top of the noises.
