## <h style="font-family:georgia"> Background: What is WA Notify? </h>

**Washington Exposure Notifications (ENX, also known as WA Notify)** is a tool that works through smartphones to alert users if they may have been exposed to COVID-19. Using Bluetooth, it allows smartphones to exchange randomly generated codes without revealing any personal information.

If another user you've been near in the last two weeks tested positive for COVID-19 and added his verification code, anyone who was in close contact will receive an exposure alert.

_If you are an iPhone user, you might have easily encountered this through your settings menu._


## <h style="font-family:georgia"> Overview </h>
The usability study combined qualitative pre and post-task interview questions and quantitative post-task usability metrics, such as Likert scales and NPS ratings.

Because majority of interaction happens once receiving an alert or testing positive for COVID, the study involved hypothetical situations, where users engaged with mockups of the interface. Having WA Notify available in two different versions for each OS (iOS and Android), AB testing was used to assess the experiences for each.

Three specific areas were assessed in the study:

1. Onboarding and enabling the notification
2. Receiving an exposure alert (hypothetical)
3. Entering a verification code once tested positive (hypothetical)


## <h style="font-family:georgia"> Objectives </h>
- **Understand first reactions** to the app, DOH website's information page, exposure alert, and overall user experience.
- **Provide evidence-based suggestions to improve the interaction** (not about the specific UIs).


## <h style="font-family:georgia"> Impact </h>
- The project was spotlighted in our HCDE program's [website newsletter](https://www.hcde.washington.edu/news/hcde-students-work-with-wa-department-of-health-to-study-covidâ€“19-exposure-notification-app).
- **Ensured** research deliverables meet the stakeholders' expectations by checking in weekly since the planning stage.
- **Provided prioritized list of recommendations** for the three areas of focus, and assessed the experience gaps between the OS to the stakeholders.

## <h style="font-family:georgia"> 1. Screener & Recruiting </h>

### Goals:


### At a Glance (Intentionally not readable):
{{< figure src="preliminary-research.png" title="Using FigJam, I visually laid out findings from past research. <br> **The white empty spaces indicated potential knowledge gaps.**" caption="Preliminary Research" width=full >}}

### Outcomes:
- Examined 5+ past research work and findings, and **organized into an affinity map to identify knowledge gaps.**
- Studies were from 2018-2019, involving evaluative research, testing design iterations and concepts. **Because past work all dealt with specific design concepts and evaluative research, it was difficult to generalize findings across different studies.**
- Lot of data was missing or not as well organized.

### Insights:
1. Preliminary research revealed the knowledge gaps and how past work has been mainly focused on testing design iterations with lack of understanding of the users.

2. In order to inform future design decisions, the primary user research was designed to focus on foundational research to understand users' needs, behaviors, pain points, and typical use cases in their sourcing workflow.

## <h style="font-family:georgia"> 2. Interviews </h>

### Goals:

- Identify major use cases and touchpoints in sourcing and data comparison
- Understand users' behaviors and pain points
- Develop user journey map of typical use cases

### Study Design:

The purpose of the study was **generative** to understand users' behaviors, needs, and pain points.

- 60 minutes of **qualitative** remotely-moderated **contextual inquiries** and **interviews** via Respondent.io
- Design of the study was 2 folds:
  1. High level start to end process of sourcing
  2. Detailed step by step of data comparison process from analyzing bids to making decisions

### Study Demographics at a Glance:

## <h style="font-family:georgia"> 3. Data Analysis & Collaborative Workshop </h>

### 3.1 Data Analysis:
{{< figure src="data-analysis1.png" title="<b> For the initial data analysis, notes from Excel was converted to Mural whiteboard, and was organized into high level themes. Each participant was color-coded. </b>"  caption="Initial Data Analysis" width=full >}}

### 3.2 Thematic Analysis and Journey Mapping:
{{< figure src="data-analysis2.png" title="" width=full >}}

- Each sticky was broken down by corresponding themes.
- Visually laying out the participants' sourcing workflow from start to end helped understand the journey of each participant.
- I was able to identify emerging patterns, characterizing behaviors, needs, and major paint points at each touchpoint in the journey.

### 3.3 Collaborative Data Synthesis Workshop:
{{< figure src="workshop.png" title="" width=full >}}

- Over two days, my supervisor/mentor and I facilitated data synthesis workshops to onboard stakeholders with the research findings. In order to make the data more digestible, I made sure the data was organized and presented concisely.
- Through affinity mapping, we had two groups of stakeholders move stickies by topics and discuss emerging patterns.

## <h style="font-family:georgia"> Research Findings & Deliverables </h>

### Outcomes & Deliverables:

- Identified three major use cases in sourcing
- Developed persona, user story, and journey map for each use case highlighting actions taken, pain points, quotes, and emotions at each touch point.
- Delivered general findings related to sourcing, and data comparison habits
  - Including **high level objectives** in sourcing and data comparison
  - **Major pain points**
  - **Recommendations for each pain point** to improve the experience
  - Showcasing examples of **data manipulation workflow step by step**

### Example of Journey Map #1 of 3 (Redacted):
{{< figure src="journey-map.png" title="<b>Example of journey map of use case #1.</b> Total 3 use cases were presented to the stakeholders. They highlighted the corresponding user story, key descriptions of the persona, behaviors, needs and pain points, quotes, and emotion scale." width=full >}} -->

## <h style="font-family:georgia"> Limitations & Challenges </h>
1. Due to the sample size, the usability metrics collected were not examined for any **statistical significance.**

2. **Recruiting was mainly convenience sampling:** More than half of the participants were affiliated with the University of Washington, which may not be fully representative of the general public of WA state.

3. The usability tasks were limited to remotely observing participants' interactions within the prototype as the tasks involved hypothetical situations, such as getting an exposure or positive test alert.

4. For the scope of the project, only limited DOH webpages were tested.
