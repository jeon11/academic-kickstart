<br>*Nashville, TN* | *Apr 2018 - Current*

Currently working on multiple projects in behavioral, EEG and fMRI studies in exploring neural mechanism of human memory. Experiments include using continuous distraction tasks to see how they affect categorical memory encoding and retrieval; using word pairs with set cosine similarity values to verify the validity of sentences, and seeing how it associates with brain activity.

<li>Devised data processing pipeline that converts speech to text using Google Speech API, analyzes subjectâ€™s task performance, and constructs data frame based on experiment paradigm</li>
<li>Coded experiment that communicates with fMRI system to explore neural mechanism in categorization and temporal organization of memory system
<li>Utilized vector space models on behavioral data to examine how semantics is mapped in memory space
<li>Developed behavioral and EEG experiments to explore the effect of cosine similarity on feature verification task
<li>Analyzed EEG data by filtering noise and artifacts using independent component analysis to create evoked response
<br>
