In Fall 2015, I took a semester off to build my own mobile app. I wanted to develop a niche-specific social media that is just for families. Starting the project with mere passion and lacking practical knowledge, I self-taught how to conduct <a href="/pdf/Homy_A1.pdf" target="_blank"_>market research</a>, design and prototype. I also had a chance to hire a developer, and won first place in <a href="http://rehoboth.co.kr" target="_blank"_>Rehoboth</a> Business Idea Competition with $5k support. I also received free office space from the state government.

<li> Developed storyboard and high fidelity prototype through iterations of market research, surveys, and user testing</li>

<li>From ideation and product management to recruiting, engaged in every aspect of early stage startup as founder</li>
<br>
**Tools and skills:** Entrepreneurship, prototyping, product management, Proto.io, Marvel, market research

## **About Homy**

**Problem Statement:**<br>
Less time is spent for families as people become more and more engaged with work and social lives, and this phenomenon is found across the world as shown above. This is problematic because we are spending the least time with the most important people in our lives while spending more time with strangers, coworkers and friends. The cause of the problem has been generally identified as increased work and commute time, and hectic individual routines.

**Design Solution:**<br>
Homy attempts to solve this growing social problem by recreating online home and allowing families to seamlessly connect. With unique post-it style fridge page, Homy wants to encourage families to communicate more often. Our mission is *to provide emotional communication service to enrich familyâ€™s real, offline relationship.*
