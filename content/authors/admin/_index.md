I am a masters student at Human Centered Design and Engineering Program (HCDE) at the University of Washington's College of Engineering.
<!-- I received my bachelors in cognitive science from UC Berkeley graduated from UC Berkeley with BA in cognitive science with concentration in computer science and cognitive psychology. -->

I previously worked as a research analyst at the [Vanderbilt Computational Memory Lab](https://memory.psy.vanderbilt.edu/w/index.php/Main_Page), facilitating various research in academia and handling large data for preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.

<!-- Just as cameras were first invented based on our visual system, I believe cognitive science and current endeavors in artificial intelligence are studies that attempt to imitate the human brain, and ultimately better understand human cognition. -->
