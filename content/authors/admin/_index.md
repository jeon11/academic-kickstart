I am a 1st year graduate student at Human Centered Design and Engineering (HCDE) program at the University of Washington.

I am a **curious, data enthusiast** passionate in **UX research**. I believe that data-driven insights are at heart to delivering a meaningful experience. With my background in data science, I use both **quantitative** and **qualitative** methods to synthesize insights and unveil users' underlying needs.

See my projects [here](#projects).
<!-- I come with a background in psychology and data science for several years. and have been working with data for several years. I My previous experiences range from research in academia to project management in various startups. -->
<!-- My previous experiences range from working as a research analyst in academia to various startups focusing in UX research, project and product management.   -->

<!-- Just as cameras were first invented based on our visual system, I believe cognitive science and current endeavors in artificial intelligence are studies that attempt to imitate the human brain, and ultimately better understand human cognition. -->
