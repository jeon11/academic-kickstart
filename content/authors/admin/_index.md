I graduated from UC Berkeley with BA in cognitive science with concentration in computer science and cognitive psychology.

I currently work as a lab manager/research analyst at [Vanderbilt Computational Memory Lab](https://memory.psy.vanderbilt.edu/w/index.php/Main_Page) directed by PI Sean Polyn, facilitating ongoing studies to explore cognitive and neural mechanism of human memory.

<!-- Just as cameras were first invented based on our visual system, I believe cognitive science and current endeavors in artificial intelligence are studies that attempt to imitate the human brain, and ultimately better understand human cognition. -->
